	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <strong>Matthew Capewell</strong>, a <strong>Software Architect</strong> from <strong>Cowes, Isle of Wight</strong>. User experience designer. Technology evangelist. Geek. Husband. Father. Fitness fanatic.</p>
	<p>I am a Microsoft Certified Professional and have a wealth of experience (read as: I'm in my 30s) at all things Microsoft with my main programming language of choice being C#. I have worked to agile principals and acted as Scrum Master for some time...basically I know how to develop software in modern medium-sized teams. I am a great proponent in the philosophy of keeping things simple. Complicated and un-thought out software is easy to create. Creating software that is simple and intuitive is extremely difficult.</p>

Either resize your browser or use my <a href="/iphone.html">mobile demo</a> to see how this website works on them little critters.</p>
