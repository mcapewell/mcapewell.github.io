#Test

This is a test to see what a basic Flatdoc documention looks like and how easy it is to write one...

##Some Component

Here is some example documention about a fictional javascript component and there should be some javacript over there on the right-hand side of the screen.

``` javascript
var myName = 'Matthew';
```

###Another Level of Heading

And some more text that really doesn't mean anything because I'm just making something simple up to fill the gap!
