If you're an old horse like me then you'll be able to remember the Internet in it's early days. A time doimated by [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities), animated gifs and websites that were permanently "under construction".

Well it was time to finally get my online presence sorted out...and here it is! My little home on the web, not under contruction for the first time since 1997 when I created my first personal website in the computer labs of the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=james+went+building+leicester">James Went building</a> (RIP) in Leicester. Of course being a part-time geek, I obviously couldn't just have a [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com/) or [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) site like everyone else now could I?

No. I wanted something that would:

1. Be a bit more geeky. I achieved this with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)
2. Show off to the world that I can build mobile first, responsive websites without the use of a pre-built theme or framework

I've decided not to put a footer or any kind of copyright on here. If you want to steal the code then help yourselves. I've even [open sourced](https://github.com/mcapewell/mcapewell.github.io) it to make it easy for you. But try and learn something from it as I've been creating websites for a very long time and hopefully I'm kinda good at it. If you take any of my words and pass them off as your own then that's fine too. You will be judged at the time of reckoning.
